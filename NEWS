    * === Released 0.7.9 ===

    Beta version of new 0.8 release.

    Syntax highlighting has been replaced with brand new syntax
    highlighting from GtkSourceView. It supports million different
    languages, and has much better performance.

    New features and improvements:
        Win32 installer includes GTK.
        Implemented print preview; implemented printing with
        text styles from the document.
        Implemented customizable output filters, for highlighting
        errors in commands output and automatic opening appropriate
        files.
        Copying file in the file selector copies its URI/path
        when appropriate.
        Added "async" mode for running shell commands: output is
        redirected to medit's parent console and medit does not
        wait for the command to terminate.

    Fixed bugs include:
        Problem with new keyboard shortcuts not applied immediately
        when set in Configure Shortcuts dialog.
        Build errors with gtk-2.6.
        Paned widgets can't be covered by document anymore.
        Lot of other bugs too.
