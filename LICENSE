medit is distributed under GPL licence, its text you can
find in COPYING file.

Portions of code are written not by me, those are clearly
marked as such (copyright headers in files copied from other
projects, or comments in source). Below is the list of
thrid-party files/code with their copyrights and licenses.

GPL is used simply because it happened so, and I am using
LGPL-ed sources, and I have no idea how I can use LGPL-ed
sources in a BSD-licensed program for instance (nor I really
want to learn about it). If you want to use my code and GPL
doesn't work for you because you have special clause in your
license which is not GPL-compatible, or other crap like that,
I will gladly release it under double license, or do something
like that. Just tell me what exactly is needed.

If you aren't too picky about legal stuff, then you can simply
take code and use it in free software as you like, provided
you leave the copyright and project name in there (unless it's a
small portion of code of course, simple copy/paste must be free
as in WTFL). This applies to all files (and only to those) which
do have copyright notice inside; WTFL will work fine for the rest.

Please tell me if I violated someone's rights, or didn't give
proper credit to someone, I'll fix it (I haven't, to my best
knowledge).
