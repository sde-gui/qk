medit is distributed under GPL licence, its text you can
find in COPYING.GPL file. Nevertheless, everything but
several lang files (see the list below) is under LGPL, see
COPYING file.

Portions of code are written not by me, those are clearly
marked as such (copyright headers in files copied from other
projects, or comments in source). Below is the list of
thrid-party files/code with their copyrights and licenses.

If you want to use my code and LGPL doesn't work for you
because you have special clause in your license which is not
LGPL-compatible, or other garbage like that, I will gladly
release it under double license, or do something like that.
Just tell me what exactly is needed.

If you aren't too picky about legal stuff, then you can simply
take code and use it in free software as you like, provided
you leave the copyright and project name in there (unless it's a
small portion of code of course, simple copy/paste must be free
as in WTFPL). This applies to all files (and only to those) which
do have copyright notice inside; WTFPL will work fine for the rest.


Third-party stuff, for debian/copyright. Everything below
is under LGPL unless noted otherwise.
