=====================================================================
=====================================================================

IRM—Insert/Replace Mode

This control function selects how the terminal adds characters to page
memory. The terminal always adds new characters at the cursor position.

Default: Replace.
Set: insert mode.
Reset: replace mode.

Description
If IRM mode is set, then new characters move characters in page memory to
the right. Characters moved past the page's right border are lost.
If IRM mode is reset, then new characters replace the character at the cursor
position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SRM—Local Echo: Send/Receive Mode

This control function turns local echo on or off. When local echo is on,
the terminal sends keyboard characters to the screen. The host does not
have to send (echo) the characters back to the terminal display. When
local echo is off, the terminal only sends characters to the host. It
is up to the host to echo characters back to the screen.

Default: No local echo
Set: local echo off.
Reset: local echo on.

Description
When the SRM function is set, the terminal sends keyboard characters to
the host only. The host can echo the characters back to the screen.
When the SRM function is reset, the terminal sends keyboard characters
to the host and to the screen. The host does have to echo characters back
to the terminal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

LNM—Line Feed/New Line Mode

This control function selects the characters sent to the host when you
press the Return key. LNM also controls how the terminal interprets line
feed (LF), form feed (FF), and vertical tab (VT) characters.
Note
For compatibility with Digital's software, you should keep LNM reset (line feed).

Default: Line feed
Set: new line.
Reset: line feed.

Description
If LNM is set, then the cursor moves to the first column on the next line
when the terminal receives an LF, FF, or VT character. When you press Return,
the terminal sends both a carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF).
If LNM is reset, then the cursor moves to the current column on the next line
when the terminal receives an LF, FF, or VT character. When you press Return,
the terminal sends only a carriage return (CR) character.

Note on LNM
When the auxiliary keypad is in keypad numeric mode (DECKPNM), the Enter key
sends the same characters as the Return key.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECCKM—Cursor Keys Mode

This control function selects the sequences the arrow keys send. You can use
the four arrow keys to move the cursor through the current page or to send
special application commands.

Default: Cursor
Set: application sequences.
Reset: cursor sequences.

Description
If the DECCKM function is set, then the arrow keys send application sequences
to the host.
If the DECCKM function is reset, then the arrow keys send ANSI cursor sequences
to the host.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECANM—ANSI Mode

DECANM changes the terminal to the VT52 mode of operation. In VT52 mode,
the terminal acts like a VT52 terminal. This mode lets you use applications
designed for the VT52 terminal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSCNM—Screen Mode: Light or Dark Screen

This control function selects a dark or light background on the screen.

Default: Dark background.
Set: reverse video.
Reset: normal display.

Description
When DECSCNM is set, the screen displays dark characters on a light background.
When DECSCNM is reset, the screen displays light characters on a dark background.

Note on DECSCNM
Screen mode only effects how the data appears on the screen. DECSCNM does not
change the data in page memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECOM—Origin Mode

This control function sets the origin for the cursor. DECOM determines if the
cursor position is restricted to inside the page margins. When you power up or
reset the terminal, you reset origin mode.

Default: Origin is at the upper-left of the screen, independent of margins.
Set: within margins.
Reset: upper-left corner.

Description
When DECOM is set, the home cursor position is at the upper-left corner of the
screen, within the margins. The starting point for line numbers depends on the
current top margin setting. The cursor cannot move outside of the margins.
When DECOM is reset, the home cursor position is at the upper-left corner of the
screen. The starting point for line numbers is independent of the margins. The
cursor can move outside of the margins.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECAWM—Autowrap Mode

This control function determines whether or not received characters automatically
wrap to the next line when the cursor reaches the right border of a page in page
memory.

Default: No autowrap
Set: autowrap.
Reset: no autowrap.

Description
If the DECAWM function is set, then graphic characters received when the cursor
is at the right border of the page appear at the beginning of the next line. Any
text on the page scrolls up if the cursor is at the end of the scrolling region.
If the DECAWM function is reset, then graphic characters received when the cursor
is at the right border of the page replace characters already on the page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECTCEM—Text Cursor Enable Mode

This control function makes the cursor visible or invisible.

Default: Visible
Set: makes the cursor visible.
Reset: makes the cursor invisible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECNKM—Numeric Keypad Mode

This control function works like the DECKPAM and DECKPNM functions. DECNKM is
provided mainly for use with the request and report mode (DECRQM/DECRPM) control
functions.

Available in: VT Level 4 mode only

Default: Numeric
Set: application sequences.
Reset: keypad characters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECBKM—Backarrow Key Mode

This control function determines whether the  key works as a backspace key or
delete key.
Note
To be compatible with some software, DECBKM should be reset (delete key setting).

Default: Delete key
Set: backspace key.
Reset: delete key.

Description
If DECBKM is set,  works as a backspace key. When you press , the terminal sends
a BS character to the host.
If DECBKM is reset,  works as a delete key. When you press , the terminal sends
a DEL character to the host.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DECKPM—Key Position Mode

This control function selects whether the keyboard sends character codes or key
position reports to the host. DECKPM lets new applications take full control of
the keyboard including single shifts, locking shifts, and compose character processing.
Default: Send character codes

Format
Set: send key position reports.
Reset: send character codes.

Description
If the DECKPM function is set, then all keyboard keys send extended reports that
include the key position and the state of modifier keys when pressed. A modifier
key is pressed in combination with another key to modify the code sent by that key.
The Ctrl key is a modifier key.
If the DECKPM function is reset, then the keyboard keys send character codes.
Note on DECKPM
DECKPM only affects keyboard input; it does not affect how the terminal interprets data
from the host.
