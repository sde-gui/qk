medit is built using cmake (http://www.cmake.org/). See
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html for detailed instructions
on how to use cmake.

Quick build with default options (you must have cmake installed):

tar xjf medit-x.x.x.tar.bz2
cd medit-x.x.x
cmake .
make
make install

This will configure, build, and install medit to /usr/local. If you want to
install it to a different directory, use the following cmake command line:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path .

Alternatively, you can run the following command after running cmake:

ccmake .

This will invoke a curses interface for cmake where you can see the list of
available options and set their values.
