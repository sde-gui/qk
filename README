Why?
====

If you are wondering why medit is written, there are two answers:
1) It wasn't a decision to write a text editor. It happened during
more than one year of GGAP development. And no, there is no usable
GTK text editor component.
2) Try it: if you like it, you know why. If you don't like it, ask
vim/emacs guys why don't they use emacs/vim.
